SEO & analytics

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, meaning, how to get search engines like Google to rank your website higher than other websites. There are people who specialize in this for living like a career.

The way SEO works is it looks for information in the H1 tags. For example, if you are a company that specialize in traveling and your H1 tags have the key word travel, then your SEO score is likely to be higher meaning customer can see you website faster than a company that have hawaii as their H1 who specializes in traveling.

It is important to be very ethical when it comes to SEO. So company should not add ghost pages or hidden text to improve their SEO. People have tried that before and their SEO score went down.

Implementing SEO

I added one h1 tags to my website "Let's Travel". I put it as part of my logo but I put it as a text. My other H1 tags are for destination like Brazil, Panama, Jamaica, Hawaii. With these H1 tags, whenever people search for the name Brazil or traveling or Panama, my website will have a chance to populate. For now, this is my initial strategy for Implementation.

My secondary strategy are gathering key words to use for h2 tags as well as possible h1 tags. My goals is to make sure that my h1 and h2 tags have buzz word for SEO scores as long as it is related to my website.
